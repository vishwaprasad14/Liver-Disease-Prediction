In this project we are going to discuss how to predict risk of liver disease for a person, based
on the blood test report result of the user. The risk of liver disease was predicted using
various machine learning algorithms. The final output was predicted based on the most
accurate machine learning algorithm.
Based on the accurate model we designed a system which asks a person to enter the details
of his/her blood test report. Then the system uses the most accurate model which is trained to
predict, whether a person has risk of liver disease or not.
